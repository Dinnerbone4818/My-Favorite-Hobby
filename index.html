        <h2> How I started coding: </h2>
        <p class="txt">  Coding is my favorite hobby. I started coding when I was around 6, but I stopped for a long time because I never understood anything. Once I was 10, I started taking BYJU's future school classes, and now I could figure out how to code! It also started to get fun, and now its a hobby! Now, I am almost 11, and I also started using a guide to create a game in python!

        <h1> Inspiration </h1>
        <p> I started gaming when I was around 8, because I wanted to be able to play with my friends. But as I grew, I got more curious how the games I play really work. My dad explained to me how coding powers technology. It seemed really cool that I can make my own games and share them to the world, just like other people are doing at this moment, so I decided to learn how to! As I learned, I realized that I was really good at coding, and I started to pick up with things really easily. So, now I am making my own games, and my own apps! </p>
